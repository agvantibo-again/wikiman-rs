## About

**Wikiman** is a universal offline documentation search engine. It can browse system manual pages, [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr), the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/), [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/), [FreeBSD documentation](https://docs.freebsd.org/), and many other sources curated by [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/).

It provides an easy interface for browsing documentation without the need to be exact and connected to the internet. This is achieved by utilizing full-text search for wikis, partial name and description matching for man pages, and fuzzy filtering for search results.

# This is a work-in-progress rewrite of wikiman by one very irresponsible and fabulously busy developer. Please use [upstream wikiman](https://github.com/filiparag/wikiman) instead until this is ready.
